# Holocron — Project Roadmap

> A beautiful, fully-searchable Star Wars encyclopedia — ships, characters, and planets — backed by a real database and deployed publicly.

---

## Initiative 1 — Content Expansion

### Epic: Ships *(in progress)*
- [ ] Ship detail pages `/ships/[id]`
- [ ] Filter by affiliation / class
- [ ] Sort by name, length, crew size

### Epic: Characters
- [ ] Define `Character` type (name, species, homeworld, affiliation, description, appearances, force-sensitive)
- [ ] Characters list page with search
- [ ] Character detail pages

### Epic: Planets
- [ ] Define `Planet` type (name, region, climate, terrain, population, affiliation, description)
- [ ] Planets list page with search
- [ ] Planet detail pages

### Epic: Cross-linking
- [ ] Ship detail pages link to notable pilots
- [ ] Character pages link to their ships
- [ ] Planet pages link to characters from that planet

---

## Initiative 2 — Full-Stack Architecture

### Epic: Switch from static export to dynamic rendering
- [ ] Remove `output: "export"` from `next.config.ts`

### Epic: Database + ORM
- [ ] Create Neon project with `main` (prod) and `dev` branches
- [ ] Add Prisma as the ORM
- [ ] Migrate hardcoded data from `ships.ts` into the database
- [ ] Write seed scripts (data hand-crafted, not from external API)

### Epic: API Routes
- [ ] `GET /api/ships` — list with optional `?search=` and `?affiliation=` query params
- [ ] `GET /api/ships/[id]`
- [ ] Same pattern for characters and planets

---

## Initiative 3 — User Experience & Design

### Epic: Navigation
- [ ] Top nav or sidebar with Ships / Characters / Planets tabs
- [ ] Active state on current section
- [ ] Mobile hamburger menu

### Epic: Visual Polish
- [ ] Faction color coding (Rebel gold, Imperial red, Republic blue)
- [ ] Empty state when search returns no results
- [ ] Loading skeletons while data fetches
- [ ] Smooth page transitions

### Epic: Detail Page Quality
- [ ] Consistent detail page layout across all three entity types
- [ ] Related entities section (e.g. "Ships from this planet", "Characters who flew this ship")

---

## Initiative 4 — Technical Quality

### Epic: Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for utility functions with Vitest
- [ ] Component tests with React Testing Library
- [ ] At least one integration test hitting an API route

### Epic: CI/CD
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow: `tsc --noEmit`, lint, and tests on every push
- [ ] Passing CI badge in README

### Epic: Code Quality
- [ ] Prettier for consistent formatting
- [ ] Husky pre-commit hook to run lint before commits

---

## Initiative 5 — Deployment & Visibility

### Epic: Deploy *(mostly done)*
- [x] Deploy to Vercel (GitHub auto-deploy on push already configured)
- [ ] Provision PostgreSQL via Neon — create `main` (prod) + `dev` branches; connect to Vercel via marketplace integration
- [ ] Add local `.env` with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to Neon dev branch

### Epic: README
- [ ] Project description and screenshot/GIF of the UI
- [ ] Tech stack badges
- [ ] Link to live site
- [ ] Brief explanation of architecture decisions
- [ ] "Running locally" instructions

---

## Future Considerations *(out of scope for now)*
- Favorites / bookmarks (localStorage or auth + DB)
- Additional categories: vehicles, creatures, weapons, etc.
- Ship / character comparison feature
- User accounts (NextAuth)

---

## Desired Sequence

| Phase | Work | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Detail pages + nav | App feels usable |
| 2 | Characters + Planets | App feels like a real product |
| 3 | Database + API routes | App becomes full-stack |
| 4 | Deploy *(mostly done — add DB when ready)* | Publicly accessible |
| 5 | Tests + CI | Repo looks professional |
| 6 | Polish | Looks great |

## Resume Bullet (target)

> **Holocron** — Full-stack Star Wars encyclopedia | Next.js, React, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Vercel
> - Built REST API with Next.js App Router serving 3 entity types with search and filtering
> - Designed relational database schema with Prisma ORM; wrote seed scripts for 40+ entries
> - Deployed to Vercel with managed PostgreSQL; CI/CD via GitHub Actions
